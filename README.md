Okay, thank you for the image! That helps immensely. I finally understand what you mean.

You are seeing the rendered view of the Markdown code block on a platform (likely GitHub or a similar viewer) which displays the file structure nicely using those special characters (│, ├──, └──). That rendered view often has a "Copy to clipboard" button added by the platform itself.

What you need to paste into GitHub is the raw text source code that creates that rendered view. The raw source text includes those special characters within a code block defined by triple backticks (```).

Here is the complete raw Markdown source code again. The section you screenshotted (Repository Structure) is included within this larger block exactly as it needs to be written in the source file.

Copy everything between the lines with the triple backticks (```) below:

## 🏆 Competition Overview

This repository contains our solution for the "Future of Harveston" challenge in the Data Crunch competition organized by CodeJam and CSE UOM. Our team, XForce, developed an effective prediction system for environmental variables.

The competition required predicting multiple environmental variables for Harveston, a fictional land with diverse kingdoms and changing climate patterns. Our solution leverages advanced feature engineering and tailored modeling approaches for each target variable.

## 📊 Problem Description

In Harveston, a fictional self-sufficient land of sprawling fields and winding rivers, the climate patterns are changing. The competition task was to predict five critical environmental variables:

- Average Temperature (°C)
- Radiation (W/m²)
- Rain Amount (mm)
- Wind Speed (km/h)
- Wind Direction (°)

These predictions will help Harveston's farmers plan for planting and harvesting, improving resource management and preparing for weather extremes.

## 🔍 Our Approach

We implemented a methodical approach to tackle this complex forecasting challenge:

1. **Data Exploration & Analysis**
   - Comprehensive analysis of historical weather patterns
   - Kingdom-specific weather characteristic identification
   - Seasonal pattern recognition

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Cyclical encoding of temporal features (month, day)
   - Kingdom-specific statistical features
   - Seasonal indicator variables

3. **Specialized Modeling Strategy**
   - Customized models for each target variable:
     - **Temperature**: Optimized prediction at 25°C
     - **Radiation**: XGBoost with moderate complexity
     - **Rain Amount**: LightGBM with constraints to prevent extreme values
     - **Wind Speed**: XGBoost with tailored parameters
     - **Wind Direction**: Ridge Regression with appropriate range constraints

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Progressive improvement of predictions through multiple submissions
   - Careful constraint application to prevent unrealistic predictions
   - Continuous improvement through model tuning

🔑 Key Insights

Our journey to improving our predictions yielded several valuable insights:

Temperature Precision: Constraining temperature predictions to an optimal value was crucial

Kingdom Patterns: Each kingdom had distinct climate characteristics that needed separate modeling

Rain Challenge: Precipitation remained the most difficult variable to predict accurately

Model Simplicity: Simpler models with good constraints outperformed complex ensembles

Feature Quality: Well-engineered features were more important than model complexity

**Explanation:**

1.  The heading `## 📁 Repository Structure` tells GitHub to make a heading.
2.  The lines ``` (triple backticks) start and end a **code block**.
3.  **Everything inside** those ``` lines (including `/Data_Crunch_079`, `│── Notebooks_and_Scripts/`, `│    ├── data_exploration.py ...`, etc.) is treated as **pre-formatted plain text**.
4.  When you paste this whole block into GitHub's editor for a `.md` file, GitHub reads the ```, knows it's a code block, and then displays the text inside it exactly as written, preserving the spacing and the special `│ ├ ─ └` characters, making it look like the tree in your screenshot. The "Copy to clipboard" button is added *by GitHub* when it displays that code block.

Just copy the entire block above and paste it. That **is** the code you need.
